//! Branding statics served at the web root.
//!
//! The framework's HTTP server has no static-file handler (its only built-in
//! path is the `/_suprnova/health` short-circuit), and the Vite pipeline only
//! covers hashed build output under `/assets/`. Browsers and the web app
//! manifest request the favicon set at the web root (`/favicon.ico`,
//! `/site.webmanifest`, ...), so the kit serves that small whitelist itself
//! from `public/` through explicit routes. Dev (`suprnova serve`) and prod
//! (the release binary) hit the exact same handler — the page origin is the
//! Rust server in both modes, with Vite only supplying JS/CSS via absolute
//! dev-server URLs.
